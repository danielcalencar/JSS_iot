\section{Conclusion}\label{section:conclusion}

Online IoT communities have emerged as a great communicative platform for IoT developers to discuss technical issues and promote the IoT projects to potential users for commercial values. Consequently, it is of great interest for IoT developers to understand the most important metrics that share a significant relationship with the popularity of IoT projects.
We explore five groups of metrics having considered $112$ explanatory metrics. We conduct an exploratory study on $1,232$ projects that are hosted on the Hackster.
We observe that the {\em project page}, {\em source-code}, {\em user comments}, and {\em user activities} groups of metrics make a significant contribution to explaining the popularity of IoT projects. On the other hand, the {\em developer profile} group of metrics does not share a significant relationship with project popularity. 
Developers can benefit from our observations to improve the popularity of their IoT projects.
In the future, we plan to expand our study to investigate more online communities.
